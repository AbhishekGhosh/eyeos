EyeOS - GNU GPL


## Context

EyeOS was an open source web desktop with many features, released under AGPL.
Actually, the creators of EyeOS decided in September 2011 to change the license of their product to a non-FLOSS one.

## Future Development of EyeOS

You can Read the [Guide for Installing EyeOS 2.5 on Rackspace Next Generation Cloud Server](http://thecustomizewindows.com/2012/09/installing-eyeos-2-5-on-rackspace-next-generation-cloud-server/).

Suck your thumb for now still I modify and publish EyeOS under GPL on my Managed Rackspace Cloud to honour [Richard Stallman](http://www.google.co.in/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&ved=0CCMQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FRichard_Stallman&ei=VNtYUJewNs7trQeugoHYAw&usg=AFQjCNG10c9SXz4GChaDA10a6HAh6HGOLw).


## Anti Trust

I am quite interested to file an anti trust. They simply abused the spirit of Open Source. But I do not have money. They have deleted all files of all previous versions from all possible official repo. 
I will do my best to delete some precious backlinks to ther domain which they got just for being an Open Source.

## No Functional Files Modified

Thats it. Except this.
